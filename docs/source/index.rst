`ElegantRL <https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL>`_ is developped for researchers and practitioners with the following advantages:.

   - **Lightweight**: The core codes  <1,000 lines (check elegantrl/tutorial), using PyTorch (train), OpenAI Gym (env), NumPy, Matplotlib (plot).

   - **Efficient**: more efficient than `Ray RLlib <https://github.com/ray-project/ray>`_ in many testing cases.

   - **Stable**: much more stable than `Stable Baseline 3 <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_.

ElegantRL implements the following model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms:

   - **DDPG, TD3, SAC, A2C, PPO(GAE) for continuous actions**
   
   - **DQN, DoubleDQN, D3QN for discrete actions**

For the details of DRL algorithms, please check out the educational webpage `OpenAI Spinning Up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_.
